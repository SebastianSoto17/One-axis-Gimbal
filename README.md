# One-axis-Gimbal
This is my final project for the class of operating systems, an STM32F446RE powered one axis gimbal.

Here you can find the code on how to make a basic one axis gimbal, the code implements kalman filters and data in real time from an accelerometer in order to give a great-balanced one axis gimbal.
